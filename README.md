The Divine Camaraderie is a self-cooperative action/puzzle game. Hop around heaven and hell as both an angel and a demon, and conjure up adverse weather to herd Dante forward through the woods so he can begin his famous tour of the afterlife. But watch out! The ground is crumbling behind him, and the fire and rain you create could very well send him to the afterlife the hard way!
This game was created for the 2022 Epic MegaJam (theme: "As above, so below"). I've been learning to use Unreal Engine for a while now, but this is the first complete game I've made with it. As such, the was a lot of learning involved, especially at the end of the development process. Like, who knew that packaged games' level streaming can behave differently from in-editor playback due to the assets not already being in RAM? I sure didn't, but I do now!

Aside from the font -- Aboreto, a wonderful OFL typeface by Dominik JÃ¡ger (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Aboreto/about) -- all of the art and sound assets are my own and were created during the one-week game jam.

The game is intended to be played with a gamepad, but it's also possible to use keyboard/mouse. Just be aware that KBM support was an eleventh-hour addition, and KBM menu navigation is janky because it.
